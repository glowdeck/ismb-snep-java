# Sample Projects #

The source will over time include a number of Java sample applications that use the library.

## Hello World ##
No programming library or project is complete without the Hello World example, and this one is no exception.
This is a Java application that uses Swing UI library to open a small GUI that shows which reader was found, and with two text fields to allow you to customize the "type" of NDEF message message, and the contents of the message.
Then press the button to send the NDEF to your phone via the reader using SNEP protocol.
